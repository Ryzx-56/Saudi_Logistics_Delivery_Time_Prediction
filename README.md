# 🚚 Saudi Logistics Delivery Time Prediction (Machine Learning)

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting delivery time in Saudi Arabia logistics operations using machine learning regression techniques. The system analyzes shipment-related factors such as distance, transportation mode, shipment type, and product weight to estimate delivery duration.

The project applies pattern recognition and supervised machine learning techniques to model delivery time prediction using the XGBoost regression algorithm.

This project was completed as part of a **Pattern Recognition academic course**.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates delivery time based on logistics shipment characteristics. Accurate delivery time prediction helps improve operational planning, logistics efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### 🔹 Problem Type
Regression Problem  
Predict continuous delivery time values.

---

### 🔹 Model Used
- XGBoost Regressor

XGBoost was selected due to its strong performance in handling complex, non-linear relationships and structured tabular datasets.

---

### 🔹 Workflow
The machine learning pipeline includes:

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
2. Feature selection and encoding  
3. Model training using XGBoost  
4. Model evaluation using regression performance metrics  
5. Result interpretation and performance comparison

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains 10,000 shipment records representing logistics delivery operations across Saudi Arabia.

### Dataset Features Include:
- Shipment distance  
- Transportation mode  
- Shipment category  
- Package weight  
- Delivery time (target variable)  

⚠️ Note:
Some dataset records were synthetically generated for academic and experimental modeling purposes.
